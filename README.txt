The four ipynb files can be run on google Codelabs. The data files need to be uploaded into Codelabs session for the scripts to run correctly.

The scripts correspond to the following model/setting
SVM_BOW_noMeta.ipynb -> SVM/BOW+lemmatization-stopwords 
SVM_BOW_meta.ipynb -> SVM/BOW+lemmatization–stopwords+sentiment+rating
NB_BOW_noMeta.ipynb -> NB/BOW+lemmatization-stopwords 
NB_BOW_meta.ipynb -> NB/BOW+lemmatization–stopwords+sentiment+rating
